But, will their vision of the world be worse than ours?&lt;br /&gt;However, what we know about the world is connected with the reality that surrounds us.&lt;br /&gt;On   one side we are limited by our senses. We see only part of the   electromagnetic waves like visible light, as part of the so-called   thermal radiation, from which we get only a minimal amount of   information. The sounds we can hear, are only at a certain frequency. We   have a lousy sense of smell and our sense of touch is very imperfect.&lt;br /&gt;We   have no senses in the perception of magnetism, radiation and many   others we could theoretically have. We would totality perceive the world   differently if we were blind and had a perfect sense of smell. We could follow the path of motion into the past and we should have a much better understanding of space and time.&lt;br /&gt;We  would have a completely different idea about the world, if we were a  million times bigger or smaller, faster or slower. If we lived under the  sea or on a comet or somehere else entirely.&lt;br /&gt;From the other side of  our vision of the world is given a model of the world that we have  received from the society in which we grew up.&lt;br /&gt;It is practical to  have a stable model of the world and the same with other people with  whom we live. But it is good to realize that the company created it  based on knowledge that was centuries ago, and it changes very slowly.&lt;br /&gt;The  new findings, which do not comply with our world view, either ignore or  ridicule, declare a falsehood, fraud or otherwise suppress. We believe  that we are right, but if we were born on the other side of the globe, a  few centuries earlier or later, our world view would be completely  different. And also we thought that we are right.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Maybe  everything is completely different than we think. This book does not  attempt to solve some specific problems. They try to only give impetus  to the development of their own thinking in trying to understand how a  computer could think.&lt;br /&gt;I do not know whether we will ever teach  computers to think, but if you are going to try, we can not understand  many of the new world, but also themselves.&lt;/span&gt;</summary>
